# react-redux-playground

Toy react application for the sake of getting my hands dirty with React, Redux, react-bootstrap, react-router, reselect, redux-actions, redux middleware, async actions and all the goodies. Also integrated redux devtools.

## why?
Looking for an elegant way of structuring a react/redux app with several different domain reducers and async actions.

I have included async actions that query the following public services: 
* giphy
    * search for animated gifs
* fixer.io 
    * fetch currency exchange rates
    
Feedback is very much welcomed :)
